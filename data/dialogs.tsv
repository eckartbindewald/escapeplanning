dialog_2	char_1	dialog_1	I see. I have some healing potions that might help. Would you like one?	[{"text":"Yes, please","next_id":"dialog_4"},{"text":"No, thank you","next_id":"dialog_3"}]
dialog_3	char_1	dialog_1	Well, let me know if you need anything else. Stay safe on your adventures!	[]
dialog_4	char_1	dialog_2	Here you go. This should help restore your health. That will be 10 gold pieces.	[{"text":"Thank you","next_id":"dialog_3"}]
dialog_5	char_2	null	*grumbles* What do you want? I'm busy.	[{"text":"I'd like a drink","next_id":"dialog_6"},{"text":"Tell me about this place","next_id":"dialog_7"},{"text":"Nothing, sorry to bother you","next_id":"dialog_8"}]
dialog_6	char_2	dialog_5	Fine. That'll be 5 gold. Don't cause any trouble in my tavern.	[{"text":"Thanks","next_id":"dialog_8"}]
dialog_7	char_2	dialog_5	This tavern's been in my family for generations. Not much to tell except we get all sorts passing through. Some say there's a secret in the cellar, but that's just nonsense.	[{"text":"Tell me about the cellar","next_id":"dialog_9"},{"text":"Thanks for the information","next_id":"dialog_8"}]
dialog_8	char_2	dialog_5	*goes back to cleaning mugs*	[]
dialog_9	char_2	dialog_7	The cellar? It's just storage. Though, come to think of it, I lost the key some time ago. Last person who went down there was some traveler heading to the forest. Odd fellow.	[{"text":"Thank you for the information","next_id":"dialog_8"}]
